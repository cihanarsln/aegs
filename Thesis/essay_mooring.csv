problem constructing docking dirigible natural cause like high wind said 6 dirigible highly flammable due use hydrogen gas made dirigible fly also another important factor project taken place highly populated area meant harm could done civilian anything ever went wrong
builder empire state building faced obstacle attempt allow dirigible dock problem violent wind blowing blimp around high altitude people onboard wind top building constantly shifting another set back illegal fly aircraft low illegal ship tie building also dangerous dirigible ran hydrogen dock hydrogen highly flammable mooring mask empire state building became nothing attraction sightseer
obstacle builder empire state building could empire state building existing law agains airship flying low urban area law would make illegal ship ever tie building even approach area although two dirigible attempt reach building entire idea dropped
want tell go attempt allow dirigible dock well tell truth go thourgh lot like one obstacle lack suitable landing area also another obstacle would say nature let tell picked obstacle keep reading want dock dirigible empire state building say want plan work many thing wrong like fact said one obstacle lack suitable landing couldnt find good landing area dirigible something bad happening another obstacle nature say nature wind blew blow away people main obstacle go caps1 allow dirigible dock
